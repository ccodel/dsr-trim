sr_parser.c:
    - When calculating min/max_clause_to_check, was previously setting the min and max to check for lit and neg_lit when subst_pair_incomplete was true, but it should be for when it is false, since we want to check clauses containing the literal that gets mapped under the substitution.
    - Previously was adding the pivot to the witness array. Now omits it.
    - When comparing hints[hint_index], I computed -(hints[hint_index] - 1) == i. Because the hint is negative, should have added one to map it from "printable" into 0-indexed.

lsr-check:
    (4/15/24): Not incrementing alpha_generation when a RAT clause is indicated but has no hints (see comment on line 249 of lsr-check.c).

dsr-trim:
    - Some invariant regarding candidate_assumed_literals_index/candidate_unit_clauses_index and RAT_assumed_literals_index/RAT_unit_literals_index was off. Refactored into increment/decrement_state(). (Needs better name.)
        - Currently increments candidate_unit_literals_index/RAT etc. when assume_unit_literal() is called, but can be computed more efficiently by setting it separately.
            - The benefits for doing this are super small.
    - Was clearing the lsr_line_size after assuming the candidate clause, leading to RAT derivations being printed when candidate UP was found. Cleared before.
    - Substitutions were set using current_generation, but were then cleared after the first RAT clause. Created a new subst_generation value to run separately from current_generation.
        - TODO: Refactor for sr-check
        - TODO: Rename current_generation (to alpha_generation?)
    - The ret val of get_lit_under_subst() can return SUBST_UNASSIGNED. Taking the up_reason of that variable gives 0 always, because I computed it before re-assigning back to the original lit.

    - (3/27/24) When doing witness minimization, the write_index was not incremented twice when writing a literal mapping, leading to non-deleted witness mappings after minimization.
    - (4/9/24) Was not adding the clause hash when adding a new clause.
    - (4/14/24) Was not removing the added literals to lits_db when deleting a clause in the DSR format. As a result, the next addition clause included all the literals of the previous deletion clause.
    - (4/15/24) When deleting a clause, the watch pointers must also be removed. But the call to delete_clause() came first, which caused a garbage collection/realloc() call to shift the underlying literals, and so the correct watch pointers weren't removed at all, leading to a spurious RAT check.

global_parsing.c:
    - Not taking the absolute value of a token, meaning that negative tokens get "mapped twice."

compress/decompress.c:
    - Writing a zero and then a newline character adds an extra space, which won't interfere with parsing, but makes the diff command line tool complain.
    - (4/9/24) Was expecting to read two zeros per addition line in DSR format. But these lines only have one zero per line.
    - (4/9/24) Was expecting text lines to start with solely numbers (isdigit()). Instead, lines can start with '-' or 'd'.
