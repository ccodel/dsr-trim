sr_parser.c:
    - When calculating min/max_clause_to_check, was previously setting the min and max to check for lit and neg_lit when subst_pair_incomplete was true, but it should be for when it is false, since we want to check clauses containing the literal that gets mapped under the substitution.
    - Previously was adding the pivot to the witness array. Now omits it.

sr-trim:
    - Some invariant regarding candidate_assumed_literals_index/candidate_unit_clauses_index and RAT_assumed_literals_index/RAT_unit_literals_index was off. Refactored into increment/decrement_state(). (Needs better name.)
        - Currently increments candidate_unit_literals_index/RAT etc. when assume_unit_literal() is called, but can be computed more efficiently by setting it separately.
            - The benefits for doing this are super small.
    - Was clearing the lsr_line_size after assuming the candidate clause, leading to RAT derivations being printed when candidate UP was found. Cleared before.
    - Substitutions were set using current_generation, but were then cleared after the first RAT clause. Created a new subst_generation value to run separately from current_generation.
        - TODO: Refactor for sr-check
        - TODO: Rename current_generation (to alpha_generation?)
