 * 
 *  The new clause is added to the formula "eagerly," because if the clause
 *  checks, then we would add it to the formula anyway.
 * 
 *  The min/max_clause_to_check are *not* updated, because possible witness 
 *  minimization during dsr-trim might adjust the ranges. These ranges are
 *  instead calculated during assume_subst().
